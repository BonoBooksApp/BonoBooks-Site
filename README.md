# BonoBooks-Site
Codebase for the BonoBook's website.


## To Do:
Work on responsiveness, especially in terms of screen sizes.
To note:
320px — 480px: Mobile devices <br>
481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets <br>
769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops <br>
1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens <br>

Focus on transferring current mockup to us percentages, and leverage bootstrap classes to work on a "mobile-first" approach.
